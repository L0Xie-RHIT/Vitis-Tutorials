%% Payload
Reshape snapshot A = mSamp x nUla = 128 x 8 cfloats into format to be  
written and read efficiently from DDR. Since First stage of MUSIC is  
row-based GSSR, A is sent I/Q interleaved column-wise to VCK190. 

% Format data into 2 streams to ease Line app implmentation on VC190

%% Payload
Two concatenated vectors:
 - Pseudo spectrum that consists of 256x2 single values
 - doa angles that consists of 32x2 single values. 
    Note 1: The returned Values represent cfloat with complex part (Q) always 0
    Note 2: The returned values for real part (I) range from 8 to 247
